how to run the jenkins container in docker

step -1 create a container

docker container run -d -P jenkins/jenkins:latest

step -2 inspect the container

docker container inspect jenkins
 
step -3 to check the process running inside the container

docker container top jenkins

step -4  to know the stats of resources consumed by the conatiner

docker container stats

step-5 to verify the logs generated by the container on STDOUT and STDRR

docker container logs  jenkins

step -6 to check the port info of the container

docker conatiner port jenkins

step -7

once we get the port take the ip of the local machine or cloud network on which the conatiner is runnig to acces the application

here let us assume port as 8080 and ip as 198.168.01.5

now to access the jenkins app go to the browser 

http://198.168.01.5:8080

it will asking for the initial admin password

it will be there on the logs or /var/jenkins_home/secrets/inintalAdminPaasowrd

step-8 

docker container run exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/inintalAdminPaasowrd

step-9 : take the password and paste it on the api

step-10 to login as jenkins user

docker conatiner exec -it jenkins /bash/bin

step-11 : to login as root user to the jenkins

docker conatiner exec -it u 0 jenkins /bash/bin

step-12 to login to the running conatiner once after the container is created 

docker container run -it jenkins /bin/bash

step-13 TO pause the running container (it will not stop the container it will pause the runnig process generally it is not recomended)

docker conatiner pause jenkins

do the docker ls to check the pause&unpause state

step -14 To resume the container

docker conatiner unpause jenkins
